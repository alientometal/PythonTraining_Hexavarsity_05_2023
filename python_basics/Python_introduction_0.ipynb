    "The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 guiding principles or software design philosophies for writing computer programs in Python. It was written by Tim Peters, a prominent Python developer. These principles emphasize simplicity, readability, and elegance in code. To see the full list of principles, you can run the following command in the Python interpreter:"

This tool is very versatile, because it allows to separate the code in cells and add documentation or report elements to make a perfect documentation. It also allows to add elements in markdown typing and html format, so it becomes a powerful tool to insert formatted text, images and graphics."

    "# Basics of variable identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable identifiers follow very basic rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They must start with an underscore (_) or some letter.\n",
    "2. They can contain letters, digits and underscores\n",
    "3. They can be of any length\n",
    "4. They cannot be **Python keywords**.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python Variables  \n",
    "Python has several types of variables natively. Starting with numeric variables, Python can work with integers, floating numbers and complex numbers. It also has strings to work with text and another type of variables called booleans to store binary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we declare variables is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`variable_name = <value>`\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of a variable cannot have spaces, it must start with a letter, it can contain capital letters or numbers inside the name.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_dog = \"Nova\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Also keep in mind that in python **everything** is an object, even elements such as integers, floats and other *variables* so all identifiers are actually references to objects that contain the value among other attributes and methods.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example of assigning a value to a variable, and how it is an object by having its own methods:"

This provides a huge advantage when working with complex structures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows to assign simultaneously to several variables and even to invert them in a fast way, many functions especially of the statistical packages work with this type of assignment. What is really happening is that the function returns a vector with the values and the multiple assignment is in charge of assigning in an orderly way the elements of the vector to each one of the identifiers.  \n",
