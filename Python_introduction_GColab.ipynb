    "# Markdown in Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "Markdown is a popular markup language that is a superset of HTML. Text can be added to Jupyter Notebooks using Markdown cells. You can change the cell type to Markdown by using the key shortcut `Ctrl` + `m` then `m` or directly specifiying in the toolbar menu. <a href= https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html>Here</a> is the documentation with some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells in Jupyter notebooks allow you to format text using simple syntax.  \n",
    "Here are the steps to use Markdown cells in Jupyter notebooks provided by Google Colab:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new notebook in Google Colab or open an existing one.\n",
    "2. Click on the \"+\" button to add a new cell.\n",
    "3. Select \"Markdown\" from the drop-down menu in the toolbar at the top of the notebook.\n",
    "4. Type your Markdown syntax into the cell, using the appropriate formatting tags. For example, to create a heading, use one or more \"#\" symbols before the text, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # This is a heading\n",
    "    ## This is a subheading\n",
    "    ### This is a sub-subheading\n",
    "\n",
    "5. To add emphasis to text, use asterisks or underscores before and after the text. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *This text will be italicized*\n",
    "    _This text will also be italicized_\n",
    "\n",
    "    **This text will be bold**\n",
    "    __This text will also be bold__\n",
    "\n",
    "6. To create lists, use hyphens or asterisks for unordered lists and numbers for ordered lists. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Item 1\n",
    "    - Item 2\n",
    "    - Item 3\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. First item\n",
    "    2. Second item\n",
    "    3. Third item\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Once you have written your Markdown, press \"Shift + Enter\" to render the Markdown into formatted text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You can also use HTML syntax in Markdown cells to format text, but it is usually simpler and easier to use the Markdown syntax.\n",
